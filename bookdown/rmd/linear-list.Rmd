# Linear List

## Array

### Hash Table

- Hash table has O(1) search time. The cost of reducing the time complexity is increasing the space complexity.
- Consider mapping something to the index.
- A hash map can be replaced by an array if the keys are related to the positions already like ASCII.

### Two Pointers

- Fast and slow pointers can edit the array in place.
- Initializing smartly can make the following less tedious (e.g. `int slow = -1, fast = 0`).
